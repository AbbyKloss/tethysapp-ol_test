# OL Test
A [Tethys](https://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/stable/) app to mess with [OpenLayers v4.6.5](https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/apidoc/).
Uses data from stations around the world to display various hydrographs for each station and places each station accurately on an OpenLayers map. I recommend poking around and figuring out what is available, many features exist and more are being added pretty consistently right now.
